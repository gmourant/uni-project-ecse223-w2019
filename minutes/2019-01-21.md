# Meeting 2

Attendees: Kelly, Georges, Imane, Mathieu, Sabrina, Sofia

## Review models

### Common 
- The relationship between User - Admin - Game is important (according to professor)
- Let's use Imane's example because she asked Gunter 
- We cannot use ```Player``` 
- Keep the super class ```GeometricObject```
- Add a ```pointValue``` attribute to the block

### Differences
- Sabrina added a ```GameSetting``` class, instead of ```Game```, that is associated with ```Paddle```
- Imane added ```GridSystem``` to manage cells, added compositions to model
- Should we say that ```Game``` is associated with ```Paddle```, ```Ball```, ```GameBlock``` or that ```Canvas``` is associated with ```Paddle```, ```Ball```, ```GameBlock```?

### Other
- Discussion: ```Game``` is not specific enough, perhaps use ```SpecificGame``` or ```GameBoard```
- For ```PlayArea```, we should use ```dimensionX``` and ```dimensionY``` (See Sabrina's)
- Keep the class ```AdminUser```

## To ask professor
- How specific does the ```Game``` class need to be?
- Do we have simultaneous instances of ```Game``` at once? Can we select between multiple games?
- Where does the ```User``` come into play? Do we need it at all? Are ```User``` and ```Admin``` separate?
- Should we have a ```Grid``` or ```Canvas``` class, as opposed to having the grid positions as attributes?
- Do we need a superclass (that may be abstract) for both the ```Paddle``` and ```Ball```? 
- Do we need a new class for ```HallOfFame``` (alternatively named ```Score```)?
- Do we list class variables as an attribute in UML?
