# ECSE 223 Group Project 9

## Introduction

Bonjour-hi! Welcome to our repository for ```Block223```, a model-oriented programming project. Please stay tuned as updates will be added continuously through the Winter 2019 semester. 

## Organisation

To better organise ourselves, we have opted to use GitHub's *project management* tools as a part of this group project. 

### Minutes

We are using the repository's wiki to document our team meetings. You can find our minutes here: https://github.com/W2019-ECSE223/ecse223-group-project-p-9/wiki

### Projects

We are using Kanban boards to facilitate the tracking of our progress (and to stay on track!). Each iteration is assigned its own project; our collection of projects can be viewed at: https://github.com/W2019-ECSE223/ecse223-group-project-p-9/projects

## Block223

### Iteration 1

The first iteration includes a domain model of the Block223 game as an ```.ump``` file. It can be found in the ```src``` directory on ```master```. In addition, the generated Java files are included from Eclipse. 

### Iteration 2

The second iteration includes a project report that can be found in the repository's wiki. It states the sequence diagrams and common UI for each feature. 

### Iteration 3

The third iteration includes ```Controller```,```Persistence```,```View```,```Application```and ```Model``` files that can be found in the ```src``` directory in ```master```. There is also a statement of work excel file to see how the work was divided.
### Iteration 4

The fourth iteration includes a project report that can be found in the repository's wiki. It states the sequence diagrams for each feature. The code created by the umple files are stated in the ```src``` directory in ```master```.
